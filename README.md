To Clone the project used the below Steps :

1. On your local comouter create a folder and name it anyting ("Group Project")
2. Then open command Prompt on the same location (either by typing cmd in url or hold shift key and right click> open in command prompt)

Once the third step is compelted you will see the entire project downloaded in "Group Project" folder

5. import all the maven dependencies

Now we need to create a local branch in you GIT and then push the branch to the GITHUB (**This is to avoid any write operations on the master branch)

1. In intelliJ open terminal
2. git checkout -b "branchname" //branchname can be the controller that u r working on example : UserController or QuestionController
3. After the bracnh is created, push the local branch to GITHUB => git push origin "branch name"
4. Now you can start working on the code and at every milestone add a commit
5. git -m commit "commit message"
6. add the commmit to git : git push origin "branch name"


Once everyone is finished with the code implementaion we will do a code review and merge the branch to get final version of the code.
